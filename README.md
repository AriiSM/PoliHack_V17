# Gene Explorer: Drug Repurposer App

### PoliHack v17 â€“ AppDev Division  
---

## Overview

**Gene Explorer** is a cross-platform application developed as part of **PoliHack v17**, under the **AppDev division**. Its main objective is to support researchers, bioinformaticians, and healthcare professionals in **exploring the complex relationships between human genes and pharmaceutical compounds**.

The application is fully responsive and can be accessed seamlessly across **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**, making it adaptable for both field work and research labs.

By integrating interactive data visualizations and AI-powered tools, the platform enables users to identify promising opportunities for **drug repurposing**â€”the process of discovering new therapeutic uses for existing medications.

##  AI Chatbot â€“ Shifty

The application integrates an intelligent biomedical assistant called **Shifty**, powered by **BioGPT**. Users can interact in natural language to retrieve information about genes, conditions, and preventative measures.

### Example Prompts:
- *"How do I prevent breast cancer?"*
- *"What is the function of BRCA1?"*
- *"What drugs interact with gene SRC?"*
