##  AI Chatbot – Shifty

The application integrates an intelligent biomedical assistant called **Shifty**, powered by **BioGPT**. Users can interact in natural language to retrieve information about genes, conditions, and preventative measures.

### Example Prompts:
- *"How do I prevent breast cancer?"*
- *"What is the function of BRCA1?"*
- *"What drugs interact with gene SRC?"*

##  Setup & Local Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AriiSM/PoliHack_V17.git
cd poli_hack
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
``` 

### 3. Run the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
``` 

### 4. Install & Configure LM Studio (for Shifty AI features)

To enable AI functionality in **Shifty**, you need to run a local LLM API using [**LM Studio**](https://lmstudio.ai/).


#### Steps:

1. **Download LM Studio** 
2. Open the application and go to the **Models** tab.
3. In the search bar, find and download the following model: akhilanilkumar_-_biogpt-baseline-gguf/biogpt-baseline.Q4_K_S.gguf
4. Once the model is downloaded, navigate to the **Server** tab.
5. Select the downloaded model and click **Start Server**.

    ##### Configuration Notes:
   - Make sure the API server runs on: `http://localhost:1234`
   - You can leave the default settings, unless you need a custom port.

    Shifty will now be able to connect and interact with the local model using this endpoint.
